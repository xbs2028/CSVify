# CSVify
This application builds off of kaushikkarthik's Exportify application:
https://github.com/kaushikkarthik/Exportify
Which can download playlist information in JSON format.

My application downloads in CSV format, includes
more parameters, and includes a "playlist search"
feature.

To run this application, simply run
### `npm install`

then
### `npm start`
