# Exportify
Exportify is a React web application that uses Spotify API to help users export song details from all their playlists as JSON. The fields currently include Track name, Album name, Artists and ISRC.

Note: Spotify has changed it's API terms to restrict the users of third-party apps from accessing it's APIs. This means that for the app to work for anyone visiting your application, their spotify email needs to be explicitly granted access from within the Spotify Developer Dashboard till it's submitted for review and approved by Spotify for wider access.
